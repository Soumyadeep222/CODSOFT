## CODSOFT

Welcome to our Repository! ðŸš€

### Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting survival on the Titanic ship using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes Python and popular libraries to analyze passenger data and predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

### Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction

A machine learning project to predict movie ratings. Using Python and scikit-learn, we explore movie data, preprocess it, and employ regression algorithms to forecast how users might rate movies based on different features.

### Project 3: Iris Flower Classification

Classifying iris flowers into different species using machine learning algorithms. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of classification models to accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on their characteristics.

### Project 4: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Anomaly detection for credit card transactions. Using Python and advanced machine learning techniques, we address class imbalance, preprocess sensitive data, and employ algorithms like Isolation Forest to detect fraudulent credit card activities among legitimate transactions.

### Repository Structure:

- `titanic_survival_prediction/`: Code and resources for the Titanic Survival Prediction project.
